<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Axiell eHUB is a media proxy between media providers and end users. It needs to call the connected media providers through their API. The current scenario is that the media provider has already its
    API (which fulfills the eHUB requirements) and the
    adapter code is written by Axiell Developers and added to eHUB. A new version of eHUB needs to be deployed each time a new provider is integrated.
</p>
<p>The following documents describe the integration process in more detail:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The <a title="eHUB Loan Process" href="eHUBLoanProcess.pdf" target="_blank">e-media loan process</a> when using eHUB</li>
    <li>The <a title="API Integration Process" href="eHUBAPIIntegrationProcess.pdf" target="_blank">process of integrating a new e-media content provider</a></li>
    <li>A list of <a title="Integration Requirements" href="eMediaContentProviderIntegrationEHUBRequirements.pdf" target="_blank">input requirements</a> for Axiell to be able
        to integrate a new e-media content provider, and test the integration
    </li>
    <li><a title="test cases" href="eMediaContentProviderIntegrationEHUBTestCases.pdf" target="_blank">Test cases</a> for testing of eHUB functionality</li>
</ul>

<p>The process of integrating a new media provider with an existing API is usually time consuming both in terms of writing a new code and communicating with
    the Provider Developers. Therefore a new approach, where a new eHUB Provider API (EP API) interface is suggested. The main idea is that if the media provider delivers a
    server code implementing EP API then no coding is required at the eHUB site and the new media provider could be added just by submitting the EP parameters
    from eHUB Administration Pages. No new version of eHUB needs to be deployed, and the media provider data is persisted in the eHUB database.
    The eHUB provider API fundamentals are described in the following documents:
