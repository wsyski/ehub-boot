<h4>RESTful Design</h4>

<p>The eHub API is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">REST</a> API over HTTP. RESTful applications are
    designed to work
    the way the web works, using HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE) to operate on resources. However, it doesn't use hyperlinks (i.e. embedded links within
    the returned response), but instead it's up to the developer to get possible necessary information from a previous response when creating a request.</p>

<h4>Authentication</h4>

<p>The eHub API uses the standard HTTP Authorization header for authentication. Therefore the Authorization header is required in all eHub API requests. See the
    <a title="eHub Provider API Security" href="security.html">security</a> page for more information.</p>

<h4>Versioning</h4>

<p>The API uses the <a href="http://semver.org" target="_blank">semantic versioning scheme</a> with the major version number being included in the path element
    of the url (e.g.
    /{version}/checkouts/{checkoutId}). If new functionality is added or changes are made which aren't backwards compatible, we will increment
    the major version and provide new calls or incompatible ones under the new version number. The old version will only be decommissioned if the transition of
    API clients to the new API version is
    complete. Field additions to existing calls are seen as non-breaking changes, thus API clients should be able to handle new fields in all responses without
    any code changes. The current version of API is v1.</p>

<h4>Response Format</h4>

<p>The eHub Provider API is a RESTful API based on the JSON format for data exchange. All requests and responses are in JSON format.</p>

<h4>Encoding</h4>

<p>All API responses are UTF-8 encoded.</p>
