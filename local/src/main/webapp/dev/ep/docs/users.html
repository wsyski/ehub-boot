<p>
    Media providers should assume that Axiell eHUB is a trusted party and all its users (library patrons) are already validated by the Local Management System
    (LMS) before taking any action in eHUB is taken. eHUB users are uniquely identified by the combination of an eHUB consumer (LMS instance) id and a patron
    id. The patron id is a string identifier assigned by LMS and it is not the same as the borrower bar code (library card), although LMS can at any time
    retrive the patron information (including the borrower bar code) for a given patron id.</p>

The use of patron ids instead of the library cards has the following advantages:
<ul>
    <li>A patron at the library could have several cards which may cause problems when enforcing the borrowing limits.</li>
    <li>The cards could be replaced, and therefore do not uniquely identify the user. The patron id remains the same as long as the patron is registered in
        LMS.
    </li>
    <li>Some libraries use social security numbers as library cards and dealing with them is restricted by the law regulations</li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is assumed that if the media provider supports the concept of users, then it creates the users at the provider site automatically when needed. If it is
    required that the users need to accept provider agreements before using their services it is suggested that the first time when the eHUB user downloads
    a digital media from the provider site the user is redirected to the media provider agreement page where he has to accept the agreement text before
    proceeding with the downloading of the media content.
