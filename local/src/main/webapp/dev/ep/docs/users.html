<p>
    Media providers should assume that Axiell eHub is a trusted party and all its users (library patrons) already validated by the Local Management System (LMS)
    before taking any action in eHub is taken. eHub users are uniquely identified by the combination of the eHub consumer (LMS instance) id and patron id.
    The patron id a string identifier assigned by LMS and it is not the same as the borrower bar code (library card), although LMS can at any time retrive
    the patron information (including the borrower bar code) for given patron id.</p>

The use of patron ids instead of the library cards has the following advantages:
<ul>
    <li>A patron at the library could have several cards which may cause problems when enforcing the borrowing limits</li>
    <li>The cards could be replaced, and therefore do not uniquely identify the user</li>
    <li>Some libraries use social security numbers as library cards and dealing with them is restricted by the law regulations</li>
</ul>
<p>
    It is assumed that if the media provider supports the concept of users, creates the users at the provider site automatically when needed. If it is required
    that the users need accept providers agreements before using their services it is suggested that the first time when the eHub user downloads a digital media
    from the provider the user is redirected to the media provider agreement page where he has to accept the agreement text before proceeding with downloading
    the media.
