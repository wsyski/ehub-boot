<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Axiell eHUB is a media proxy between media vendors and end users. It needs to call the connected media providers through their API.
    connecting eHub to their providers. The current scenario is that the media provider has already its API (which fulfills the eHub requirements) and the
    adapter code is written by Axiell Developers and added to eHub. This is usually time consuming both in terms of writing a new code and communicating with
    the Provider Developers. Also a new version of eHub needs to be deployed each time a new provider is implemented.
</p>

<p>Therefore a new approach is suggested and a new Ehub Provider API (EP API) interface is designed. The main idea is that if the media provider delivers a
    server code implementing EP API then no coding is required at the eHub site and the new media provider could be added just by submitting the EP parameters
    from eHub Administration Pages. No new version of eHub needs to be deployed, and the media provider data is saved in the eHub database.</p>
