    <h3>eHUB API Design</h3>
    <p></p>

    <h4>RESTful Design</h4>
    <p>The eHUB API is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a> API over HTTP. RESTful applications are designed to work the way the web works, using HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE) to operate on resources. However, it doesn't use hyperlinks (i.e. embedded links within the returned response), but instead it's up to the developer to get possible necessary information from a previous response when creating a request.</p>

    <h4>Authentication</h4>
    <p>The eHUB API uses the standard HTTP Authorization header for authentication. Therefore the Authorization header is required in all eHUB API requests. See the <a title="Security page" href="security.html">Security</a> page for more information.</p>

    <h4>Versioning</h4>
    <p>To support future changes, a version number is included in the URL paths for eHUB APIs. It is also possible that the body of the requests and responses may vary between the different versions, see <a href="#schemas">XML Schemas</a> below.</p>

    <h4>Response Format</h4>
    <p>Currently, XML is the only supported response format.</p>

    <h4>Encoding</h4>
    <p>All API responses are UTF-8 encoded.</p>

    <h4 id="schemas">XML Schemas</h4>
    <p>For convenience an XML schema for each version of the eHUB APIs is published below. These schemas can be used for generating client side code.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="xsd/v1/ehub.xsd" title="XSD for API version 1">Version 1</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
