<h4>Best Practices</h4>
<p>Below you'll find some points that will help you use the eHUB APIs effectively.</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        It is recommended to always get the available formats before a loan is created, since the available formats for
        a specific record may vary. See the <a title="Formats API" href="../apis/formats.html">Formats API</a> for more
        information.
    </li>
    <li>
        It is not necessary to provide the user credentials when getting the formats, however it is still recommended to
        do so when it opens up the possibility to check whether the end-user might be able to checkout a record or not.
    </li>
    <li>
        Even though language is optional in all requests, it is still recommended to provide the <a title="ISO 639"
                                                                                                    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes">ISO
        639</a> alpha-2 or alpha-3 language code of the desired language the response should be in.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="error">Error Handling</h4>
<p>Since the eHUB API is a RESTful API the <a href="http://restpatterns.org/HTTP_Status_Codes">HTTP status code</a>
    indicates the type of error. A JSON containing the cause of the error is also included in the body of the response.
</p>
<h5>Here's what an error response looks like</h5>
<pre>
{
    "cause":"CONTENT_PROVIDER_ERROR",
    "message":"The Content Provider ELIB3 returned the following error status code: The book is unavailable to loan when it lacks a valid business model ",
    "arguments":[
        {
            "value":"ELIB3",
            "type":"CONTENT_PROVIDER_NAME"
        },
        {
            "value":"The book is unavailable to loan when it lacks a valid business model ",
            "type":"CONTENT_PROVIDER_STATUS"
        }
    ]
}
</pre>
